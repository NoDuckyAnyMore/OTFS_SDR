function c = genltegoldseq(Mpn, c_init)
% ### INPUT PARAMETERS ###
%   - Mpn: the length of the final sequence c()
%   - c_init: Initial condition of the polynomia x2()

% Initial condition of the polynomia x1(). This is fixed value as described in 36.211 7.2
x1_init = [1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
           0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
           0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
           0];

% Initial condition of the polynomia x2().
% This is supposed to be used as c_init as described in 36.211 7.2
x2_init = c_init;

% Nc as defined in 36.211 7.2
Nc = 1600;

% Create a vector(array) for x1() and x2() all initialized with 0
x1 = zeros(1,Nc + Mpn + 31);
x2 = zeros(1,Nc + Mpn + 31);

% Create a vector(array) for c() all initialized with 0
c = zeros(1,Mpn);

% Initialize x1() and x2()
x1(1:31) = x1_init;
x2(1:31) = x2_init;

% generate the m-sequence : x1()
for n = 1 : (Mpn+Nc)
   x1(n+31) = mod(x1(n+3) + x1(n),2);
end

% generate the m-sequence : x2()
for n = 1 : (Mpn+Nc)
   x2(n+31) = mod(x2(n+3) + x2(n+2) + x2(n+1) + x2(n),2);
end

% generate the resulting sequence (Gold Sequence) : c()
for n = 1 : Mpn
    c(n)= mod(x1(n+Nc) + x2(n+Nc),2);
end
